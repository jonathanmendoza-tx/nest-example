# Nest Example

Analysis of transaction data from a nest device

## Project Overview

- Observations regarding dataset
- Feature engineering of nest dataset
- Hypothesis of useful models for detecting anomalies
- Client-side and server-side traffic visualized
- Examples of baseline models
- How these models may be implemented with current product architecture

### Tech Stack

- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib

### Models

Used IsolationForest and LocalOutlierFactor from sklearn to detect potential anomalies

### Data Sources

Nest dataset

### Feature Requests

I would love to hear from you about new features which would improve this analysis and further the aims of the project. Please provide as much detail and information as possible to show why you think your new feature should be implemented.
